    "\n",
    "We give a proof by contradiction. Suppose that we don’t get a pair of blue socks or a pair of black socks. Then we drew at most one of each color. This accounts for only two socks. But we are drawing three socks. Therefore our supposition that we did not get a pair of blue socks or a pair of black socks is incorrect, and our proof is complete.\n",
