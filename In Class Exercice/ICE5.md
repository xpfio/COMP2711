Here this exercice was to write ENTIRELY and FORMALY all the steps for a given proof.


# Question 1

By direct proof

|   |                                     |                               |
|---|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | m is a rational number              | hypothesis                    |
| 2 | n is a rational number              | hypothesis                    |
| 3 | ∃p∃q in ZxZ, m = p/q, q not nul     | 1. definition                 |
| 4 | ∃r∃s in ZxZ, m = r/s, s not nul     | 2. definition                 |
| 5 | m+n = ...                           | 3,4                           |
| 6 | ∃u∃v in ZxZ, m + n = u/v, v not nul | 5. Existential Generalization |
| 7 | m+n is a rational number            | Conclusion                    |


# Question 2

By contraposition

|   |                                     |                               |
|---|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | not(a<=√n or b<=√n)                 | hypothesis                    |
| 2 | a > √n and b > √n                   | logic equivalence             |
| 3 | a.b > √n.√n                         | multiplication                |
| 4 | ab > n                              | 2. definition                 |
| 5 | not(n=ab)                           | Conclusion                    |
