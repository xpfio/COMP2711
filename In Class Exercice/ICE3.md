# Question 1 

## 1)a) False

Counter-example:  
U = {a,b}  
P(a) = True  
Q(a) = False  
P(b) = False  
Q(b) = True  

We have For all x, (P(x) or Q(x)) (P or Q are true all the time)  
But ∀x P(x) is False and ∀x Q(x) is False

## 1)b) True

Direct proof


## 1)c) True

Direct proof, there is a such as P(a) and Q(a) so  
there is x (a) such as P(x) is true  
there is x (a) such as Q(x) is true

## 1)d) False

Counter-example:  
U = {a,b}  
P(a) = True  
Q(a) = False  
P(b) = False  
Q(b) = True  

# Question 2

Common mistake, supposing x and y are integer, it's clearly stated that they are real numbers.

## 2)a) True

Take y = (5-x)/2.

## 2)b) False

Can't find such an x.

## 2)c) 

Take x = 5 - 2y.


# Question 3

Directly **∀x∃y [ (F(x) and P(x) → M(x,y) ]**
